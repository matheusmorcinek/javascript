=== The difference of using var, let and const. ===

Three things to pay attention to when declaring variables in JavaScript. 
1 - Scope 
        In JavaScript there are two types of scope: Local scope and Global scope. 
        JavaScript has function scope, Each function creates a new scope.
        Also, the scope dermines the accessibility (visibility) of these variables.
        Variables defined inside a funcion are not accessible (visible) from outside the function.
2 - Redeclaration
3 - Hoisting



var 
   Function Scope
   Var accepts to be redeclared normally

let 
   block scope
   let will throw an error when redeclaring the variable, but once the variable is declared we can change the value of this variable.
   the Hoisting for let are not initialized with undefined like the var, so we need to declare in the correct order, in order to use the variable.
const





JavaScript Hoisiting - hoisting to the upper level. The JS compiler hoists all the VAR variables and functions declarations before executing the code.
