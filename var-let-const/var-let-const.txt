=== The difference of using var, let and const. ===

Three things to pay attention to when declaring variables in JavaScript. 
1 - Scope 
        In JavaScript there are two types of scope: Local scope and Global scope. 
        JavaScript has function scope, Each function creates a new scope.
        Also, the scope dermines the accessibility (visibility) of these variables.
        Variables defined inside a funcion are not accessible (visible) from outside the function.
2 - Redeclaration
3 - Hoisting



var 
   Function Scope
   Var accepts to be redeclared normally

let 



const





JavaScript Hoisiting - hoisting to the upper level. The JS compiler hoists all the VAR variables and functions declarations before executing the code.
