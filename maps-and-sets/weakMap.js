//WeakMap vs Map
/*
    The keys are weak, and can be garbage collected.

    ***How they're the same***
    
    >  Both contain key-value pairs
    >  Both allow you to set, get, delete and check for key-value pairs 

    ***Key Differences***

   >   The most significant difference is related to keys. With WeakMap's you cannot use primitive data type as a key, WeakMap's keys must be objects.
   >   WeakMap does not have all of the same methods and property as Map, including the ability to iterate over the object or get its size.
